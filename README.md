# Langur Extension

## Installation

To install the extension, install [**bun**](https://bun.sh), the best Node.js all-in-one toolkit.

Clone the repository and run:

```bash
bun i
bun run build
```

Enable **developer mode** in Chrome Extensions, and load the built `dist/` folder as an unpacked extension.
